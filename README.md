# RL_Implementations
This repository contains the implementation of different RL problems with various RL algorithms in PyTorch. 

This repository uses the Pytorch RL implemenations from below library. This library contains the implementations of various RL
algorithms wrapped around a framework for execution. For RL practitioners, I would highly recommend this library and would like to 
convey my thanks to the author for the wonderful work.

Above library, contains the implementations for OpenAI Gym environments. I have modified the library slightly towards implementing
custom environments. You can find following problems under 'custom_environments' directory:

1. Snake Game

Pls follow this repo to find the latest updates.
